This is the Rust module for the BattleEngine.

It is used to process battles with millions of units efficiently with
the least amount of memory as possible and is theoretically 30-50x faster than doing the same from PHP.

This Rust library is called from PHP FFI in the `RustBattleEngine` class in PHP.
